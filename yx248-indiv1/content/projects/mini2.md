# AWS Lambda Function with Rust

This mini-project involves creating a simple AWS Lambda function using Rust. The function will process and transform sample data, showcasing the integration of AWS Lambda with the Rust programming language through Cargo Lambda.

## Requirements

- **Rust Lambda Function**: The core of this project is to develop an AWS Lambda function using Rust. This requires setting up a Rust environment and using Cargo Lambda, a command-line tool for managing AWS Lambda functions written in Rust.
- **Data Processing**: Implement logic within the Lambda function to process and transform sample data. The specifics of the data and the type of processing required will depend on the project guidelines provided.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Set up an API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function. This involves configuring an API endpoint that invokes the Lambda function upon receiving a request.


## Deliverables

- **Lambda Function Code**: The Rust source code for the Lambda function, including any dependencies or additional libraries used.
- **API Gateway Configuration**: Documentation or screenshots detailing the API Gateway setup and configuration.
- **Data Processing Example**: A brief explanation or demonstration of the data processing performed by the Lambda function, including before and after examples if applicable.
- **Project Documentation**: A README file or equivalent documentation providing an overview of the project, setup and deployment instructions, and any other relevant information.
