# AWS Lambda Data Processor

This mini-project involves creating a simple AWS Lambda function to process data. The primary goal is to understand the basics of AWS Lambda and how it can be utilized for serverless data processing tasks.

## Mini-Project: Create an S3 Bucket using CDK with AWS CodeWhisperer

Participants will also create an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with assistance from AWS CodeWhisperer. This will involve generating CDK code for the S3 bucket creation, configuring bucket properties such as versioning and encryption.


## Requirements

- **Create S3 bucket using AWS CDK**: Utilize the AWS CDK to programmatically define and deploy an Amazon S3 bucket.
- **Use CodeWhisperer to generate CDK code**: Implement AWS CodeWhisperer to aid in generating the CDK code necessary for creating the S3 bucket.
- **Add bucket properties**: Configure the S3 bucket with essential properties such as versioning and encryption to ensure data integrity and security.


## Deliverables

- **CDK app code**: The complete source code of the CDK application used to create the S3 bucket.
- **Generated S3 bucket screenshot**: A screenshot showing the successfully created S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
- **Writeup explaining CodeWhisperer usage**: A detailed explanation of how AWS CodeWhisperer was used to generate the CDK code, including any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
